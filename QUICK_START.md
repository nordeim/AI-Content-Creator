# Quick Start Guide

## You Have Two Options:

### Option 1: Use the Current Frontend (Recommended for Testing)
The frontend is already live and can be tested:
**URL**: https://krxypi6hki7u.space.minimax.io

You can explore:
- Home page with features
- Login/Registration forms
- UI and navigation

*Note: Registration and content generation won't work until backend is connected.*

### Option 2: Complete Full Setup (15 minutes)

**Required Credentials:**
1. Supabase URL and keys (from https://supabase.com)
2. OpenAI API key (from https://platform.openai.com)

**Quick Commands:**
```bash
# 1. Set credentials
export SUPABASE_URL="your_supabase_url"
export SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your_anon_key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"

# 2. Run setup
cd /workspace/ai-content-creator
./setup-backend.sh

# 3. Follow the interactive prompts
```

**What the script does:**
